# Deep Learning Notes
This respository contains short notes on Deep Learning research publications that I read.   
This idea was borrowed from [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz) and his [notes repository](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).


## Natural Language Processing
[Linguistic Regularities in Continuous Space Word Representations](notes/regularities-in-cont-word-repr.md) - Mikolov et al. [[paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N13-1090)]   
[Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space](notes/efficient-esti-of-word-repr.md) - Mikolov et al. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)]  
[Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning To Align and Translate](notes/jointly-learn-to-align-and-translate.md) - Bahdanau et al. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)]
