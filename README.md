# Deep Learning Notes
This respository contains short notes on Deep Learning research publications that I read.   
This idea was borrowed from [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz) and his [notes repository](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).


## Natural Language Processing
